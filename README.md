# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CREDIT_CARD_RISK

During my value-added course with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Credit Risk Classification Model using Python to predict the likelihood of credit approval based on customer demographics, financial behavior, and credit history. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting data types, mapping categorical variables, and treating outliers through the IQR method. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I identified key factors such as prior default, credit score, years of employment, and income that significantly influenced loan approval outcomes. I trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, across different data splits. This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and model evaluation, offering hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to financial risk assessment.
